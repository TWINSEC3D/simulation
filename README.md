<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project provides the source code for a car seat warehouse simulation. It is based on Docker container technology and serves as a cybersecurity testbed using the Wazuh SIEM platform. Each simulation container is individually monitored by a Wazuh agent.

### Built With

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
